## v-final-3 — Full Consistency Sync: Backtest + Live → Paper Trade Reference (2026-03-29)

### Summary
Complete audit of all three modes (Backtest, Paper Trade, Live Trade).
Found **7 logic differences** — 1 critical bug, 2 high-impact gaps, 4 missing risk controls.
Paper Trade is now the reference implementation. All modes behave identically.

---

### CRITICAL FIX — Trail 50% Floor/Ceiling Swapped in Backtest

**File:** `src/services/backtestEngine.js`

**Before (BUG):**
```js
// CE trail: Math.min → took the LOWER value = trail gets stuck at entryPrevMid
const effectiveTrailSL = position.entryPrevMid !== null ? Math.min(trailSL, position.entryPrevMid) : trailSL;

// PE trail: Math.max → took the HIGHER value = trail gets stuck at entryPrevMid
const effectiveTrailSL = position.entryPrevMid !== null ? Math.max(trailSL, position.entryPrevMid) : trailSL;
```

**After (FIXED — matches paper/live exactly):**
```js
// CE trail: floor = trail cannot sit BELOW entryPrevMid
const clipped = fiftyPctFloor !== null && trailSL < fiftyPctFloor;
const effectiveTrailSL = clipped ? fiftyPctFloor : trailSL;

// PE trail: ceiling = trail cannot sit ABOVE entryPrevMid
const clipped = fiftyPctCeiling !== null && trailSL > fiftyPctCeiling;
const effectiveTrailSL = clipped ? fiftyPctCeiling : trailSL;
```

**Impact:** Winning trades in backtest were not locking in profits correctly.
CE trail SL was capped *down* at entryPrevMid — never tightened past it.
PE trail SL was capped *up* at entryPrevMid — never tightened past it.
Backtest results were non-representative of live/paper trailing behaviour.

---

### HIGH FIX — SL Hit Detection Changed from candle.close to candle.low/high

**File:** `src/services/backtestEngine.js`

**Before:** `candle.close < position.stopLoss` (SL only hit if candle CLOSES below SL)
**After:** `candle.low <= position.stopLoss` for CE, `candle.high >= position.stopLoss` for PE

**Why it matters:** Paper/live check SL on every tick. A candle can wick through SL
and recover by close — backtest used to survive this, paper/live would exit.
Using `candle.low`/`candle.high` as intra-candle proxy now matches tick-by-tick behaviour.
Backtest was previously overstating win rate by ignoring wick SL hits.

---

### HIGH FIX — 50% Entry Gate Added to Live Trade

**File:** `src/routes/trade.js`

**Before:** Live trade had NO 50% entry gate. Paper trade had it since simulateBuy().
**After:** Both candle-close and intra-candle entry paths now check:
```js
const violates = (side === "PE" && spot > entryPrevMid) ||
                 (side === "CE" && spot < entryPrevMid);
if (violates) { /* block entry — no directional room */ }
```

**Why it matters:** Without this gate, live trade could enter trades where the 50% exit
rule would fire on the very first tick — a guaranteed loss. Paper trade already blocked
these entries. Live was taking trades that paper would never take.

---

### 50% Entry Gate Added to Backtest

**File:** `src/services/backtestEngine.js`

Same 50% entry gate logic added before entry creation.
Previously had a comment explaining why it was intentionally skipped —
but this caused backtest to take trades that paper/live would never take.

---

### Risk Controls Added to Backtest (4 features)

**File:** `src/services/backtestEngine.js`

All 4 risk controls now match paper trade:

| Control | Paper | Backtest (before) | Backtest (after) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Daily loss kill switch (MAX_DAILY_LOSS) | ✅ | ❌ Missing | ✅ Added |
| Max daily trades cap (MAX_DAILY_TRADES) | ✅ | ❌ Missing | ✅ Added |
| Consecutive loss pause (3 losses) | ✅ | ❌ Missing | ✅ Added |
| Same-candle SL re-entry block | ✅ | ❌ Missing | ✅ Added |

All use the same env vars: `MAX_DAILY_LOSS=5000`, `MAX_DAILY_TRADES=20`.
3 consecutive losses on 15-min: kills the day. On 5-min: pauses 4 candles.
SL re-entry block: only fires on initial SL hit (not trailing SL exit).

State variables reset at start of each new trading day in the backtest loop.

### Behaviour Matrix After This Release

| Feature | Live | Paper | Backtest |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signal logic (getSignal) | Same ✅ | Same ✅ | Same ✅ |
| Trail 50% floor/ceiling | Correct ✅ | Correct ✅ | **Fixed** ✅ |
| SL hit detection | tick-by-tick ✅ | tick-by-tick ✅ | **low/high proxy** ✅ |
| 50% entry gate | **Added** ✅ | Has it ✅ | **Added** ✅ |
| `TRAIL_ACTIVATE_PTS` default | 15 ✅ | 15 ✅ | 15 ✅ |
| Dynamic `trailActivatePts` (25% SAR gap) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tiered trail gap (T1/T2/T3) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `_slHitCandleTime` skipped on trail exit | ✅ | ✅ | **Added** ✅ |
| `_slHitCandleTime` skipped on 50% exit | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| Daily loss kill switch | ✅ | ✅ | **Added** ✅ |
| Consecutive loss pause | ✅ | ✅ | **Added** ✅ |
| Max daily trades cap | ✅ | ✅ | **Added** ✅ |
| `initialStopLoss` stored on position | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `trailActivatePts` stored on position | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Expected Backtest Impact

After deploying these changes, re-running the backtest will show:
- **Fewer total trades** — 50% entry gate + risk controls block bad entries
- **Lower win rate** — SL wick hits now correctly detected
- **More accurate trailing** — profits are locked in properly (trail no longer stuck)
- **Results that match paper/live** — the entire point of this release

The previous backtest showed 80 trades / 82.5% win rate / ₹2,92,704 total PnL.
Expect all three numbers to decrease. The new numbers will be *honest*.

### Files Changed

| File | Changes |
|---|---|
| `src/services/backtestEngine.js` | 6 fixes (trail bug, SL detection, 50% gate, 4 risk controls) |
| `src/routes/trade.js` | 1 fix (50% entry gate on both entry paths) |
| `src/routes/paperTrade.js` | No changes (reference implementation) |
